We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 400 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.</p>\\n\\n<p>The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don&#39;t come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.</p>\\n\\n<p>We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming language with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We&#39;ve got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world&#39;s largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you&#39;re interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there&#39;s no better place.</p>\\n\\n<p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there&#39;s a lot of room for growth.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com.

It might be your user\\u2019s first time on the internet, so you cannot take established web habits for granted. And internet connectivity is frequently an issue, so think about shipping offline capability in your v1 release and not many months and several thousand users down the line. You want the challenge of developing regional technology talent and building the best software company with people who are hungry to learn and grow their skills, even when the tradeoff is a longer release timeline.</p>\\n\\n<p>You will work closely with the leadership team of MindSky and the Akilah Institute to conceptualize the products needed to liberate us from expensive, half-baked off-the-shelf solutions to build excellent in-house technology specifically designed to power educational outcomes in emerging markets. You will carefully consider the right stack to use to keep our codebase light and our UI mobile-friendly. You will have the opportunity to spearhead East Africa\\u2019s burgeoning tech scene and establish yourself and MindSky as the region\\u2019s undisputed tech thought leaders and innovators. You\\u2019ll be entering a scrappy work culture that has never had formal tech leadership, but which nonetheless pushed ahead to build and market a software solution that already has thousands of users.</p>\\n\\n<p>We\\u2019re raising our Series A now, so everyone is doing a bit more than they bargained for. As such, you\\u2019ll be called upon to do much more than a typical CTO at a funded startup: hire your developers without a VP of engineering to help you manage them, define and implement a development methodology that is right for our team, context, and market, bake the perfect lasagna when everyone seems hungry for spaghetti, guide the IT administration and systems networking, and manage product until we\\u2019re ready to hire a product lead, all while staying focused on choosing the right languages and application frameworks and keeping your team on track to release an ambitious set of features in the next five years.</p>\\n\\n<p>You will have a nearly blank canvas upon which to paint your prototypes. If you\\u2019ve always wanted to make your mark somewhere, come with us. It\\u2019s going to be a crazy ride. This role is for the nimble optimist hungry for risk and adventure.</p>\\n\\n<p>Duties</p>\\n\\n<p>Complete the build of MindSky Careers, including product requirements and release planning for user messaging, administrative dashboard, online payments, and a matching algorithm, to name just a few of the features slated for launch.\\nConceptualize and write acceptance criteria for a tuition and financial aid platform that tracks tuition payments and mines user data through machine learning to make data-based decisions on borrower loan terms.\\nDevelop a ticketing system to allow users to submit issues for platforms they use.\\nConduct a data security audit to ensure our platforms are positioned to support institutional clients at scale.\\nEstablish an application deployment process and supervise deployment to staging and production servers.\\nBe the authority for campus-wide IT administration, helping hire staff and make decisions regarding IT infrastructure that supports thousands of students.\\nShare knowledge, mentor, and educate MindSky\\u2019s investors, management, staff, partners, customers, and stakeholders with regard to the company\\u2019s technological vision, opportunities, and challenges.\\nContribute to open source software development, standardization of technologies, and evolution of best practices by collaborating with MindSky\\u2019s peers, releasing code, presenting at conferences, and writing for publication. (OR: You have a very good and compelling reason we should NOT be open source.)\\nEnsure MindSky\\u2019s internal technological processes and customer-facing services comply with community expectations and applicable laws and regulations for privacy, security, and social responsibility.\\nBuild a local team of developers, product managers, UX/UI designers, and QA specialists.</p>\\n\\n<p>Skills and Qualifications</p>\\n\\n<p>You have no less than ten years experience managing developers in an enterprise software company.\\nYou have significantly contributed to or led the development of at least one web-based service that met consumer needs or solved business problems.\\nYou bring hands-on experience coding in more than one currently popular web application framework.\\nYou are familiar with more than one software development methodology.\\nYou are able to discern user requirements and develop specifications that meet business needs \\u2014 we will ask for examples!\\nYou have contributed to one or more open source project \\u2014 show us your GitHub.\\nYou understand Internet protocols and RFC standards, database management systems, and revision control systems.\\nYou are expertly familiar with information security vulnerabilities, risk management, consumer privacy, and payments industry compliance requirements.\\nBonus if you have exposure to business theory, business process development, governance processes, management, budgeting, and administrative operations.\\nYou want the startup life or have already lived it and thrived.\\nBeing based in Nairobi, Kenya or Kigali, Rwanda sounds exciting.\\nYou have the patience of a high school science teacher.\\nYou want to build, nurture, and train your own team.</p>\\n\\n<p>Benefits and Perks</p>\\n\\n<p>Very flexible and young work environment.\\nUnlimited vacation \\u2014 we treat you like an adult.

Founded by a spirited individual that had an eye for simplicity and a drive for success, Healthcare&#39;s first product was a small time-tracking device for nurses with a single button. Hardware has always been in Nedap&#39;s DNA, evolving in the preceding eighty plus years from mechanical to electrical devices that started to include or be connected to more and more software.</p>\\n\\n<p>Nowadays, Nedap Healthcare builds mostly software, both for the web and mobile platforms. We help nurses, doctors, and patients manage their daily life by allowing them to focus on what is important.</p>\\n\\n<p>We are looking for an experienced Ruby on Rails engineer. Our teams have been using Rails since some of the earliest releases and are comprised of people with 10+ years experience as well as people who are just getting started.
